# Lispector

I love Lisp. I love programming languages. I love building up stuff for fun.

So, while studying functional programming - more precisely, while reading
[Structure and Implementation of Computer
Programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/) - I decided try out the concepts and
build a Lisp interpreter from the ground up.

I don't know where I want to get with this, but generating Rubinius bytecode is
an interesting idea.
